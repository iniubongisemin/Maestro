Objective: Create a snake game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

======================================== Task Breakdown ========================================

Task 1:
Prompt: The objective is not yet fully achieved. Below is the next sub-task to move towards creating the snake game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

**Sub-Task 1: Set up the basic HTML structure for the Snake game.**

**Prompt for Subagent:**

Your task is to create the basic HTML structure for the Snake game. Follow the steps below:

1. Create a new HTML file named `index.html`.
2. Add the basic HTML boilerplate code.
3. Create a `div` element with an `id` of `game-board` where the game will be rendered.
4. Include references to an external CSS file (`style.css`) and a JavaScript file (`script.js`).

Please provide the `index.html` code after completing these steps.

**Expected output:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Snake Game</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="game-board"></div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Once this HTML structure is ready, we will move on to the next steps which involve setting up the CSS and JavaScript to bring the game to life.
Result: Sure, here's the basic HTML structure for the Snake game as per the provided steps:

1. Create a new HTML file named `index.html`.
2. Add the basic HTML boilerplate code.
3. Create a `div` element with an `id` of `game-board` where the game will be rendered.
4. Include references to an external CSS file (`style.css`) and a JavaScript file (`script.js`).

Here is the `index.html` code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Snake Game</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="game-board"></div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

This provides the basic structure required to start developing the Snake game. Next, we will move on to setting up the CSS and JavaScript to create the game's appearance and functionality.

Task 2:
Prompt: The objective of creating a snake game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is not yet fully achieved. We have only completed the structure of the HTML file. The next step involves setting up the basic styling for the game board using CSS.

Here’s the next sub-task:

### Next Sub-Task:
Create a CSS file named `style.css` and define the styles for the game board and game elements. This will ensure that the game board is properly rendered on the screen and has a basic visual appearance.

### Prompt for Subagent:
Please create a `style.css` file with the following styles for the snake game. Make sure to include comments for clarity where needed:

1. Style the `#game-board` to have a fixed size, centered on the screen, with a border to visualize the game area.
2. Define styles for the snake and food elements.

#### Expected CSS (`style.css`):
```css
/* General Reset */
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Style for the game board */
#game-board {
    width: 500px;
    height: 500px;
    background-color: #000;
    border: 1px solid #fff;
    margin: 50px auto;
    position: relative;
}

/* Style for the snake segments (will be defined dynamically in JavaScript) */
.snake-segment {
    width: 20px;
    height: 20px;
    background-color: #0f0;
    position: absolute;
}

/* Style for the food element (will be defined dynamically in JavaScript) */
.food {
    width: 20px;
    height: 20px;
    background-color: #f00;
    position: absolute;
}
```

After completing the styling, we can then proceed to implement the JavaScript functionalities for the game logic, including snake movement, food placement, and collision detection.

Please execute the above task and ensure the styles are correctly applied to `index.html`.
Result: Below is the `style.css` file as per the provided instructions. This will be used to style the game board, snake segments, and food elements for the Snake game.

Create a new file named `style.css` and add the following content:

```css
/* General Reset */
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Style for the game board */
#game-board {
    width: 500px;
    height: 500px;
    background-color: #000;
    border: 1px solid #fff;
    margin: 50px auto;
    position: relative;
}

/* Style for the snake segments (will be defined dynamically in JavaScript) */
.snake-segment {
    width: 20px;
    height: 20px;
    background-color: #0f0;
    position: absolute;
}

/* Style for the food element (will be defined dynamically in JavaScript) */
.food {
    width: 20px;
    height: 20px;
    background-color: #f00;
    position: absolute;
}
```

This CSS file ensures the game board is centered with a fixed size and adds visual styles for the snake segments and food items, making them visible on the screen. 

Once the `style.css` file is created, ensure it is correctly linked to the `index.html` file, as we did in the previous step:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Snake Game</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="game-board"></div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Next, we will move on to implementing the JavaScript to add the game functionality, such as controlling the snake’s movement, generating food items, and handling collisions.

Task 3:
Prompt: The objective has not yet been fully achieved, as we still need to implement the JavaScript to add the game functionality, such as controlling the snake’s movement, generating food items, and handling collisions.

Next sub-task:
Implement the initial JavaScript functionality for the Snake game. This will include setting up the game loop, initializing the snake and food positions, and rendering them on the game board.

Here is a detailed prompt for the subagent to execute this sub-task:

### Prompt

1. Create a new file named `script.js`.

2. Set up the initial variables and data structures required for the game, including the snake body and food position.

3. Implement a function to render the snake and food on the game board.

4. Add the main game loop function to update and render the game state at a fixed interval.

Make sure to check the code for errors and offer fixes or improvements as necessary.

#### Code Implementation

```javascript
// Create a new file named `script.js` and add the following content:

// Select the game board element
const gameBoard = document.getElementById('game-board');

// Define the size of each grid cell
const cellSize = 20;

// Initialize the snake with a starting position
let snake = [{ x: 100, y: 100 }];

// Initialize the food with a random position
let food = getRandomFoodPosition();

// Set the initial direction of the snake's movement
let dx = cellSize;
let dy = 0;

// Function to generate a random position for the food
function getRandomFoodPosition() {
    const maxCells = 500 / cellSize;
    const x = Math.floor(Math.random() * maxCells) * cellSize;
    const y = Math.floor(Math.random() * maxCells) * cellSize;
    return { x, y };
}

// Function to render the snake and food on the game board
function render() {
    // Clear the game board
    gameBoard.innerHTML = '';

    // Render the snake
    snake.forEach(segment => {
        const snakeSegment = document.createElement('div');
        snakeSegment.style.left = `${segment.x}px`;
        snakeSegment.style.top = `${segment.y}px`;
        snakeSegment.className = 'snake-segment';
        gameBoard.appendChild(snakeSegment);
    });

    // Render the food
    const foodElement = document.createElement('div');
    foodElement.style.left = `${food.x}px`;
    foodElement.style.top = `${food.y}px`;
    foodElement.className = 'food';
    gameBoard.appendChild(foodElement);
}

// Function to update the game state
function update() {
    // Calculate the new position of the snake's head
    const newHead = { x: snake[0].x + dx, y: snake[0].y + dy };

    // Add the new head to the front of the snake
    snake.unshift(newHead);

    // Remove the last segment of the snake
    snake.pop();
}

// Main game loop
function gameLoop() {
    update();
    render();
    setTimeout(gameLoop, 100); // Adjust the speed of the game by changing the timeout value
}

// Start the game loop
gameLoop();
```

In this JavaScript code:
- We initialize the game board, snake, and food positions.
- We have a function `getRandomFoodPosition` to generate a random position for the food.
- The `render` function clears the game board and then re-renders the snake and food at their current positions.
- The `update` function calculates the new position of the snake's head and updates the snake's body accordingly.
- The `gameLoop` function is the main loop that continuously updates and renders the game state.

### Next Steps
- After implementing and testing this part of the game, the next sub-task will involve handling snake movement through user input (keyboard events), and ensuring the snake can grow by eating food and handling collisions with the walls and itself.

Execute these steps and check the code for any errors or improvements.
Result: Below is the implementation of the initial JavaScript functionality for the Snake game as described in the prompt.

Create a new file named `script.js` and add the following content:

```javascript
// Select the game board element
const gameBoard = document.getElementById('game-board');

// Define the size of each grid cell
const cellSize = 20;

// Initialize the snake with a starting position
let snake = [{ x: 100, y: 100 }];

// Initialize the food with a random position
let food = getRandomFoodPosition();

// Set the initial direction of the snake's movement
let dx = cellSize;
let dy = 0;

// Function to generate a random position for the food
function getRandomFoodPosition() {
    const maxCells = 500 / cellSize;
    const x = Math.floor(Math.random() * maxCells) * cellSize;
    const y = Math.floor(Math.random() * maxCells) * cellSize;
    return { x, y };
}

// Function to render the snake and food on the game board
function render() {
    // Clear the game board
    gameBoard.innerHTML = '';

    // Render the snake
    snake.forEach(segment => {
        const snakeSegment = document.createElement('div');
        snakeSegment.style.left = `${segment.x}px`;
        snakeSegment.style.top = `${segment.y}px`;
        snakeSegment.className = 'snake-segment';
        gameBoard.appendChild(snakeSegment);
    });

    // Render the food
    const foodElement = document.createElement('div');
    foodElement.style.left = `${food.x}px`;
    foodElement.style.top = `${food.y}px`;
    foodElement.className = 'food';
    gameBoard.appendChild(foodElement);
}

// Function to update the game state
function update() {
    // Calculate the new position of the snake's head
    const newHead = { x: snake[0].x + dx, y: snake[0].y + dy };

    // Add the new head to the front of the snake
    snake.unshift(newHead);

    // Remove the last segment of the snake
    snake.pop();
}

// Main game loop
function gameLoop() {
    update();
    render();
    setTimeout(gameLoop, 100); // Adjust the speed of the game by changing the timeout value
}

// Start the game loop
gameLoop();
```

### Explanation:

- The game board element is selected using `getElementById`.
- The snake is initialized with a starting position and the food is placed randomly within the game board.
- Directions of movement (`dx` and `dy`) are set to move the snake to the right initially.
- `getRandomFoodPosition()` generates a random position for the food based on grid cells.
- The `render()` function handles clearing the game board and rendering the snake and the food at their respective positions.
- The `update()` function updates the snake's position by adding a new head and removing the last segment to create the illusion of moving forward.
- `gameLoop()` is the main game loop function, responsible for continuously updating and rendering the game state at a regular interval using `setTimeout`.

You can now link this `script.js` file to your `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Snake Game</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="game-board"></div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Next Steps:

After implementing and testing this part of the game, the next sub-task will involve handling snake movement through user input (keyboard events), ensuring the snake can grow by eating food, and handling collisions with the walls and itself.

Please proceed with this implementation and confirm that the initial setup works correctly. If there are any errors or improvements needed, they should be addressed before moving on to the next sub-task.
